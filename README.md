# Dog Stander

Can your neighbours really stand your dog? I don't think so. And if you are still unsure, try this app out. Inspired by `Digital Dogsitter` I created an open-source application to track the noise from your room, while you are out and about.

## How it works?

It simply records audio and formats the data to be human person readable, genius, right?

## Wan to try it out?
